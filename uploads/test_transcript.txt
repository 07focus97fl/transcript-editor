0:00 - 0:05 SPEAKER_01: Okay, so what problem do you think we have with solving problems?
0:05 - 0:10 SPEAKER_00: Well, that I can't do it. Oh, good. Did you tell me that I can't solve problems?
0:05 - 0:07 SPEAKER_01: Oh are you serious?
0:12 - 0:13 SPEAKER_00: unintelligible
0:13 - 0:37 SPEAKER_01: I mean, I think you can't do it. It's a little strong. Sorry about that. I mean, I think it just, I think I want things solved sometime sooner, or I want like solutions presented. Or you know what I'm saying? And I feel like instead of trying to solve a problem... Yeah, I get that. You don't want to confront it at all.
0:37 - 0:53 SPEAKER_00: That's, I mean, it is true that sometimes I don't. I don't feel like confronting problems. It's very true. I won't deny that. There are times that I don't want to. I want to let something sit. I don't want to look at it right then. It's true. I
0:53 - 0:53 SPEAKER_01: don't want to
0:53 - 1:06 SPEAKER_00: feel criticized by, you know, I could solve this or I look. You know I'm always looking three steps ahead. Or, you know, I can't. I don't know. I mean, it's who I am. I mean, yes, I can work on it, but
1:06 - 1:30 SPEAKER_01: Well, I don't know that I need you to work on it tremendously. I think it's just more of a... I mean, it sounds to me like you're just more bothered by... Well, we've talked about it a million times. I mean, me saying I am a different person than you, Andy. And I do, I do tend to see, I mean, you know, like, I see the thing falling off the shelf before it does because it was placed on the edge. Does that make sense at all?
1:20 - 1:20 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
1:30 - 1:35 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I see that. That's interesting. Yeah. But I don't know that that means that... criticize me
1:35 - 1:39 SPEAKER_01: No, but probably what I need from you... Well, I don't necessarily
1:39 - 1:50 SPEAKER_00: see something, you know, or I don't automatically see the solution like you see it. Or if I see a different solution.
1:50 - 1:51 SPEAKER_01: Okay, I
1:51 - 2:13 SPEAKER_00: don't know. I mean, I understand that. I mean, yeah, I wish that it wasn't an issue that I could just see things like you see them or even, you know, not all the time, but even some of the time or most of the time or whatever, so that it wasn't, you know, so that it wasn't a concern for you.
2:13 - 2:23 SPEAKER_01: Okay. Well, I don't think what you're thinking concerns me concerns me about it. What concerns me is the fact that you don't want to face them.
2:23 - 2:26 SPEAKER_01: Okay, I don't fully believe that you can't.
2:26 - 2:31 SPEAKER_00: That part, yes. Again, it's not that I don't want
2:31 - 2:32 SPEAKER_01: to face problems.
2:30 - 2:32 SPEAKER_01: That's what concerns me.
2:32 - 2:37 SPEAKER_00: It's not that I don't want to face problems.
2:34 - 2:39 SPEAKER_01: I think it's in your personality, though, to be non confrontational about anything
2:39 - 2:45 SPEAKER_00: It is definitely true that there are times that I don't want to face problems, that I'd rather wait and face them at a different time.
2:45 - 2:56 SPEAKER_01: Okay, and that would be okay. I think if you could give me something to say, "Hey, I don't want to face this right now. I should be ready by...".
2:56 - 2:57 SPEAKER_00: You get upset if I do that.
2:57 - 3:09 SPEAKER_01: Well, I get upset because for you it's a deflection, so I need more than that. I need more than, "Hey, I'm just not ready right now." I need, "Hey, I'm not ready right now, but I should be in a day, a week, a month."
3:09 - 3:10 SPEAKER_00: Okay.
3:10 - 3:21 SPEAKER_01: Do you know what I'm saying? Because the reality is, from my side of it, you tend to, so I just think you are putting off hoping it just goes away and that doesn't happen.
3:21 - 3:22 SPEAKER_00: No, I know that it doesn't happen. All right, I'll give you a deadline. If I want to put something off, I'll give you a deadline.
3:22 - 3:37 SPEAKER_01: I mean, I truly believe I can be understanding about you needing some time to process it, but I need to know when you'll be ready.
3:37 - 3:37 SPEAKER_00: I'll give you that deadline, I'll give you that deadline then.
3:37 - 3:44 SPEAKER_01: I mean, again, I don't think that's too big of a deal or too hard to
3:44 - 3:48 SPEAKER_00: I don't think it is.
3:48 - 3:59 SPEAKER_01: So I mean, yeah, I don't think the issue you're bringing up has to do with solving problems. Do you know what I'm saying?
3:59 - 4:06 SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know what it has to do with, but I don't know what category to put it under. I was honestly trying to pick something minor.
4:06 - 4:17 SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Well, I mean, I feel bad that you feel criticized, but I do feel like a lot of that's innate to you.
4:17 - 4:22 SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I mean, if I don't want to talk about something right now. I do feel that that upsets you.
4:22 - 4:24 SPEAKER_01: Well, it does. I just told you why, though.
4:24 - 4:25 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
4:25 - 4:28 SPEAKER_01: I mean, can you understand that? I can, but if
4:28 - 4:31 SPEAKER_00: I give you a deadline, then it shouldn't upset you.
4:31 - 4:35 SPEAKER_01: Right? And I agree with that. I mean, unless you say ten years from now.
4:35 - 4:48 SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm not going to do that. Honestly, sometimes it might be... I mean, it wouldn't even probably be as long as a day maximum. Can we talk about it tonight? Can we talk about this after whatever?
4:42 - 4:42 SPEAKER_01: Yeah
4:48 - 4:52 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and I really don't have problems with that, you know.
4:52 - 4:54 SPEAKER_00: Okay, we'll put that to the test.
4:54 - 4:58 SPEAKER_01: Okay, that's fine. So, I guess that's the strategy for that.
4:58 - 5:01 SPEAKER_00: I'll admit I'm a little skeptical, but I'll put that to the test.
5:01 - 5:14 SPEAKER_01: Well, you never have. That's just it. And again, my reason for reacting poorly to it is because your personality seems to be not wanting to confront the problem at all, so I think you've partially put me off hoping to never have to talk about it.
5:14 - 5:19 SPEAKER_00: I don't know that I agree with that, but I will give you a deadline and we'll see if that... Okay.
5:19 - 5:41 SPEAKER_01: We have eight minutes and we probably still have like five, so. You think? Okay. Really? Yeah, I mean we have to be able to talk about it for eight minutes and we're being recorded, so... Anything else wrapped into that? I mean, you know. But Andy, our differences, I don't think you should ever feel criticized by. I mean, think about that.
5:22 - 5:22 SPEAKER_00: I doubt it
5:41 - 5:43 SPEAKER_00: Well, that's a different topic altogether, but yeah.
5:43 - 5:57 SPEAKER_01: Well, it might be, but you brought it up during this. I did, I did. You said, you know, you made the comment that, you know, because I think, you know, I'm not criticizing you when I say that. That's not my intention or my... And even pointing out differences.
5:57 - 5:58 SPEAKER_00: But when you say can't you see that?
5:58 - 6:00 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
6:00 - 6:14 SPEAKER_00: I feel very criticized when you say things like can't you see that? Or, you know, does that make sense to you? Well, it makes sense to you. It may not make sense to me. What you can see, I may not see. What I see, you may not see.
6:14 - 6:24 SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah, that's all true. I mean, yeah. But, you know, kids do find Oreos. Can't you see that's an issue? I mean, you did.
6:24 - 6:25 SPEAKER_00: Of course, that is
6:25 - 6:26 SPEAKER_01: I mean, you know
6:26 - 6:30 SPEAKER_00: I mean, I didn't advise them to do it, but that's a different story. Yeah.
6:30 - 7:43 SPEAKER_01: But I mean, some of that, you know, some of the predictions, you know, come from unfortunately what's happened before. Not just us, but just in life. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, you know. Right. Yeah. And I do. And I think the main difference is that I can see, I just... And I honestly think this is also what changes a little bit about me too. That I think about multiple things. Does that make sense? That could happen. And I think you are more of a singular person. Does that make any sense at all? Mm hmm. And I don't... For the most part, I don't expect you to be like me. I don't want you to be like me. I mean, I hope you don't want me to be like you. But there are, you're right, there are sometimes... And I can't think of any specific examples right now that like I feel like, you know, can't you see the danger in that or something? More about things like that that are dangerous or that... You know what I'm saying? That's more of my concerns, you know? About like an animal or a kid getting hurt because... As a result. Does that make sense?
7:43 - 7:44 SPEAKER_00: Mm hmm.
7:44 - 7:49 SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Something that is just setting it up for that. You know.
7:49 - 7:51 SPEAKER_00: Like putting something on the roof.
7:51 - 7:58 SPEAKER_01: Yes. Yes. Something like that. That I feel like is just... Yeah. I mean.
7:58 - 8:02 SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure of any specific examples, but I mean, yeah.
